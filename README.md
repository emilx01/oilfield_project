The Oilfield Project is a Django-based management system designed to streamline oilfield operations and resource tracking. It provides a structured backend for monitoring field activities and managing industrial equipment data through a scalable Python architecture.

The system is fully containerized using Docker and Docker Compose, ensuring a consistent environment for development and production. The project structure separates core logic within the oilfield_operations directory from modular resource management in the resources folder, using .env files for secure configuration.

Deployment is handled via Docker for automated setup or through a standard Python virtual environment for local development. This approach provides a professional, secure, and efficient foundation for industrial data management.
